# pld-bypasses
Bypass blocksi and time restrictions on PLD issued by school. These restrictions may be too harsh on some, thus, I have included some ways to remove these restrictions.
# How to use
1) Go to https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home to download this respository by inputting the link
2) After downloading the zip file, extract all files in it.
3) You should see several bypasses to suit your needs
#Time-restriction-bypass
To bypass the 11pm time's up notification (force shutdown), just run the cancel-shutdown.vbs file, which will automatically cancel any shutdowns later (periodically every 5 minutes).
# Blocksi web filter bypass
To bypass the web extension filter (blocksi), just run the disable-extensions-blocksi.vbs file. This creates another shortcut to an unblocked chrome via the remove extensions flag.
